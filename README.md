TODO: split these into separate projects and gits, probably?

Contains:
- profunctor: builds a profunctor out of a functor and a contravariant. (why is this not a standard instance? maybe it's useless.)

- monoid-object: to...construct monoidal objects in haskell? sounds silly.
- Dyck: parsing for balanced paren sequences? sounds silly but ah well.

- tcmp: attempts to understand typeclass metaprogramming. it did not go well and I do not like overlapping instances.

- free-lattice-product:
    - tooling to visualize and build lattices, in particular products and free products
        - (I did not get to that.)
    - experiments with representing things as data types and typeclasses
